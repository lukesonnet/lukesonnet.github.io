I have helped teach an undergraduate data analysis class focused on the causes and consequences of political and a graduate course on causal inference. Below are some relevant materials I have collected and presented that may be of use to others.

## Causal inference

* [An introduction to (robust) standard errors (pdf)](/teaching/inference/200d_standard_errors.pdf) [(Rmd)](/teaching/inference/200d_standard_errors.Rmd)
* [An introduction to using R (data frames, simple models, simulations, sampling, and functions) (pdf)](/teaching/inference/200d_r_manual.pdf) [(Rmd)](/teaching/inference/200d_r_manual.Rmd)
* [Visualizing selection on observables (pdf)](/teaching/inference/200d_soo.pdf) [(Rmd)](/teaching/inference/200d_soo.Rmd)

## Undergraduate Data Analysis

### Resources

I prefer working in R ([Download R](http://cran.rstudio.com/)). It is easy to use RStudio to edit your R code and produce R Markdown files ([Download RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)). Hopefully you have used these before in PS 6 or a similar course. If not, there are many resources available on the web, and I will link some of them here shortly.

R Markdown is a great tool to interleave code and writings. I have set up a quick manual and an example of its use to get you started:

* [R Markdown Manual](/teaching/rmd/usingRMarkdown.html)
* [Example HTML](/teaching/rmd/enp_example.html) [[.Rmd code that produce it](/teaching/rmd/enp_example.Rmd)]

However, I also will be teaching with Stata in some situations. To that end, I have also created the following resource:

* [Stata tutorial](/teaching/stata/sonnet_stata_tutorial.html)

### Data Visualization

* [Should the y-axis always go to zero?](http://byjustinfox.com/2014/12/14/the-rise-of-the-y-axis-zero-fundamentalists/) - Justin Fox
* Don't use pie charts: see [here](http://www.gilliganondata.com/index.php/2009/12/02/how-succinctly-can-i-explain-why-pie-charts-are-evil/) and [here](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/08-21-07.pdf). For a counter-argument that there are may be a *few* times when a pie chart is okay, see [here](http://speakingppt.com/2013/03/18/why-tufte-is-flat-out-wrong-about-pie-charts/).
