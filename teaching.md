I have helped teach an undergraduate data analysis class focused on the causes and consequences of political and a graduate course on causal inference. Below are some relevant materials I have collected and presented that may be of use to others. I also include some tutorials I have developed for presentation to graduate students in the UCLA Political Science department.

## Causal inference

* [An introduction to (robust) standard errors (pdf)](/teaching/inference/200d_standard_errors.pdf) [(Rmd)](/teaching/inference/200d_standard_errors.Rmd)
* [An introduction to using R (data frames, simple models, simulations, sampling, and functions) (pdf)](/teaching/inference/200d_r_manual.pdf) [(Rmd)](/teaching/inference/200d_r_manual.Rmd)
* [Visualizing selection on observables (pdf)](/teaching/inference/200d_soo.pdf) [(Rmd)](/teaching/inference/200d_soo.Rmd)

## Machine Learning Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

A short tutorial on how to implement in R a simple version of a data-driven approach to uncovering heterogeneous treatment effects proposed by [Athey and Imbens (2015)](https://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/athey/documents/HeterogeneousEffects.pdf). [The tutorial can be found here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l2k9jp5dfd1uen8/Sonnet_AtheyImbensHeterogeneousEffects.pdf?dl=0).

An official package has now been released by Susan Athey and friends and can be found [here](https://github.com/susanathey/causalTree)

## Downloading Facebook and Twitter Data using Python

Put together for a workshop on January 29, 2016, this tutorial and accompanying example scripts provide a guide to downloading Facebook and Twitter data using their APIs. Done entirely in Python, this tutorial takes advantage of several Python modules to ease data collection and storage.

* [Main tutorial in HTML](https://www.dropbox.com/s/p66hneka7bu50ru/Sonnet_API_FacebookTwitter.html?dl=0) [[IPython Notebook]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/quoev77zd3mclzx/Sonnet_API_FacebookTwitter.ipynb?dl=0)
* [scrape_facebook.py](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gifdpf0x7hqxpho/scrape_facebook.py?dl=0)
* [scrape_twitter.py](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5m18rb9ki5tyt4f/scrape_twitter.py?dl=0)

## Undergraduate Data Analysis

### Resources

I prefer working in R ([Download R](http://cran.rstudio.com/)). It is easy to use RStudio to edit your R code and produce R Markdown files ([Download RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)). Hopefully you have used these before in PS 6 or a similar course. If not, there are many resources available on the web, and I will link some of them here shortly.

R Markdown is a great tool to interleave code and writings. I have set up a quick manual and an example of its use to get you started:

* [R Markdown Manual](/teaching/rmd/usingRMarkdown.html)
* [Example HTML](/teaching/rmd/enp_example.html) [[.Rmd code that produce it](/teaching/rmd/enp_example.Rmd)]

However, I also will be teaching with Stata in some situations. To that end, I have also created the following resource:

* [Stata tutorial](/teaching/stata/sonnet_stata_tutorial.html)

### Data Visualization

* [Should the y-axis always go to zero?](http://byjustinfox.com/2014/12/14/the-rise-of-the-y-axis-zero-fundamentalists/) - Justin Fox
* Don't use pie charts: see [here](http://www.gilliganondata.com/index.php/2009/12/02/how-succinctly-can-i-explain-why-pie-charts-are-evil/) and [here](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/08-21-07.pdf). For a counter-argument that there are may be a *few* times when a pie chart is okay, see [here](http://speakingppt.com/2013/03/18/why-tufte-is-flat-out-wrong-about-pie-charts/).
