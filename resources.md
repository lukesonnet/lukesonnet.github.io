## Machine Learning Estimation of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects

A short tutorial on how to implement in R a simple version of a data-driven approach to uncovering heterogeneous treatment effects proposed by [Athey and Imbens (2015)](https://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/athey/documents/HeterogeneousEffects.pdf). [The tutorial can be found here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l2k9jp5dfd1uen8/Sonnet_AtheyImbensHeterogeneousEffects.pdf?dl=0).

## Downloading Facebook and Twitter Data using Python

Put together for a workshop on January 29, 2016, this tutorial and accompanying example scripts provide a guide to downloading Facebook and Twitter data using their APIs. Done entirely in Python, this tutorial takes advantage of several Python modules to ease data collection and storage.
