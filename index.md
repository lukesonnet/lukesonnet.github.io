I'm Luke Sonnet, a recent PhD in Political Science from UCLA. I will be joining Facebook as a Research Scientist on the Demography and Survey Science team in August 2020.

[My research](/research) focuses on the behavior of legislators and voters. My research uses largely experimental and quasi-experimental methods to study the effects of political communication, the role of political dynasties, and how social norms and female political participation. Most of my applied work is based in Pakistan.

I also contribute to social scientific research by releasing data, building statistical software, and research in machine learning. Two projects I have contributed to include [estimatr](https://declaredesign.org/r/estimatr), an R package of estimators commonly used by social scientists, and the [voteview.com](https://voteview.com) project that now estimates and hosts DW-NOMINATE ideal scores of US legislators, and more. You can see more about the software I have worked on [here](/software).
