Hello! My name is Luke Sonnet, I am a PhD student in Political Science at UCLA.

I am mostly interested in electoral accountability, although I also care about broader issues in development and governance as well as machine learning in the social sciences. I have recently conducted field work in Pakistan on effect of increased communication between parliamentarians and constituents and in Northeastern Nigeria on the effects of violence and displacement. Other projects use experimental and observational evidence on the effect of anti-corruption campaigns on political participation, fine-grained spatial data to study the relationship between governance and electricity load shedding in Pakistan, and a custom machine learning technique to estimate correlates of foreign fighter supply to the civil war in Syria and Iraq.

I am also interested in improving political science education for the large number of undergraduate students who take courses in the discipline. To that end I helped design and teach a course with Miriam Golden that uses data analysis and active learning in lab to explore the determinants and consequences of political corruption.

Lastly, I care about open access to code, research, and data. If I've done anything that makes you doubt this is true, let me know right away so I can fix it!

You can find me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/LukeSonnet">@LukeSonnet</a>, where I tweet mostly about research transparency, and on <a href="http://github.com/lukesonnet">GitHub</a>. I am also the organizer of the UCLA Comparative Politics Association Conference, now in its sixth year. You can find more information at our website <a href="http://polisci.ucla.edu/content/compass">here</a>. Below are some of my thoughts.
