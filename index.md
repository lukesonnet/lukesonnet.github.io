Hello! My name is Luke Sonnet, I am a PhD candidate in Political Science at UCLA.

My research focuses on electoral accountability, the relationship between governance and development, and the role that machine learning can play in the social sciences. I have spent much of the past year or so in both Pakistan and Nigeria, and continue to work in Pakistan on several field projects. One project, joint with Miriam Golden and Saad Gulzar, is a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of increased communication between parliamentarians and constituents and is funded by the [Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/).

Other projects use experimental and observational evidence on the effects of anti-corruption campaigns on political participation and fine-grained spatial data to study the relationship between governance and electricity load shedding in Pakistan. In two separate projects with Chad Hazlett and George Derpanopoulos, I have worked to extend flexible yet interpretable machine learning techniques to both binary and zero-inflated count outcomes.

I have also helped developed [estimatr](estimatr.declaredesign.org), an R package of estimators commonly used by social scientists that is written to be both fast and to provide standard errors that reflect the current state of the art estimators in the literature. I also contributed in various ways to the [voteview.com](voteview.com) project that now hosts the DW-NOMINATE data placing US legislators on a two-dimensional ideological map. Those interested in the data can use the R package I built, [Rvoteview](https://github.com/voteview/Rvoteview), to query our database and download portions of it.

Lastly, I care about open access to code, research, and data. If I've done anything that makes you doubt this is true, let me know right away so I can fix it!
