My name is Luke Sonnet, I am a PhD candidate in [Political Science at UCLA](https://polisci.ucla.edu/) and a graduate student affiliate of the [California Center for Population Research at UCLA](https://ccpr.ucla.edu/). I have recently been a [J-PAL Replication Fellow](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/sonnet) a Lahore University of Management Sciences-World Bank Pakistan@100 Pre-Doctoral Fellow.

[My research](/research) focuses on communication and electoral accountability, social norms and political participation, and the role that machine learning can play in the social sciences.

I have also developed software with others, including [estimatr](https://declaredesign.org/r/estimatr), an R package of estimators commonly used by social scientists, and the [voteview.com](https://voteview.com) project that now estimates and hosts DW-NOMINATE ideal scores of US legislators, and more.
