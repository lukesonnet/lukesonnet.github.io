Hello! My name is Luke Sonnet, I am a PhD student in Political Science at UCLA.

I am mostly interested in electoral accountability, although I also care about broader issues in development and governance as well as machine learning in the social sciences. I am implementing a field experiment in Pakistan on the effect of increased communication between parliamentarians and constituents with Miriam Golden and Saad Gulzar. I have also recently completed field work in Northeastern Nigeria studying the effects of violence and displacement. Other projects use experimental and observational evidence on the effect of anti-corruption campaigns on political participation, fine-grained spatial data to study the relationship between governance and electricity load shedding in Pakistan. In two separate projects with Chad Hazlett and George Derpanopoulos, I have worked to extend flexible yet interpretable machine learning techniques to both binary and zero-inflated count outcomes.

I am also interested in improving political science education for the large number of undergraduate students who take courses in the discipline. To that end I helped design and teach a course with Miriam Golden that uses data analysis and active learning in lab to explore the determinants and consequences of political corruption.

Lastly, I care about open access to code, research, and data. If I've done anything that makes you doubt this is true, let me know right away so I can fix it!

You can find me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/LukeSonnet">@LukeSonnet</a>, where I tweet mostly about research transparency, and on <a href="http://github.com/lukesonnet">GitHub</a>. I also organized the UCLA Comparative Politics Association Conference for three years. You can find more information at the website <a href="http://polisci.ucla.edu/content/compass">here</a>. Below are some of my thoughts.
